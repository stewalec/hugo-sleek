# Hugo Sleek

## _Simple and sleek Hugo theme_

Hugo Sleek is a fork of **[XMin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin)** by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org). It contains the following modifications:

- Enabled responsive tables with scrollbar. Fixes table overflow on small screens.
- Added site title above the navigation menu
- Updated how post titles and dates are displayed
- Included tag list in `.article-meta` of posts
- Updated rendered whitespace as a style preference
- Other minor stylistic updates

Although it is a minimal theme, it is fully functional. It supports pages (including the home page), blog posts, a navigation menu, tags, and RSS.
